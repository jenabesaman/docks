The error message you're seeing indicates that MongoDB requires a specific version of `libssl1.1` that is not currently available on your system¹². This issue can occur if you're using a newer version of Ubuntu that has upgraded `libssl` to version 3¹.

Here are a few options to resolve this issue:

1. **Force the installation of `libssl1.1` by adding the Ubuntu 20.04 source**¹:
```bash
echo "deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu focal-security main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/focal-security.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libssl1.1
```
After running these commands, you can try installing MongoDB again. Once MongoDB is installed, you should remove the `focal-security` list file you just created¹:
```bash
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/focal-security.list
```

2. **Download the Debian file of the required version of `libssl1.1` and install it manually**²:
```bash
sudo wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/o/openssl/libssl1.1_1.1.1f-1ubuntu2_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i libssl1.1_1.1.1f-1ubuntu2_amd64.deb
```
After running these commands, you can try installing MongoDB again².

Please note that these methods involve adding a security repo for a different Ubuntu version or manually installing a package, which might have security implications¹². If you're concerned about this, you might want to consider upgrading to a newer version of MongoDB that is compatible with the newer version of `libssl`¹².

===============================================================

To install MongoDB 4 on Ubuntu, you can follow these steps⁴⁵:

1. Import the public GPG key for MongoDB:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-4.4.asc | sudo apt-key add -
```

2. Create a list file for MongoDB:
```bash
echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu bionic/mongodb-org/4.4 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.4.list
```

3. Reload the local package database:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

4. Install MongoDB:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org=4.4.4 mongodb-org-server=4.4.4 mongodb-org-shell=4.4.4 mongodb-org-mongos=4.4.4 mongodb-org-tools=4.4.4
```
This command installs MongoDB 4.4.4. If you want to install a different version of MongoDB 4, replace `4.4.4` with your desired version⁵.

5. Prevent upgrades of MongoDB packages which might break compatibility with current version⁴:
```bash
echo "mongodb-org hold" | sudo dpkg --set-selections
echo "mongodb-org-server hold" | sudo dpkg --set-selections
echo "mongodb-org-shell hold" | sudo dpkg --set-selections
echo "mongodb-org-mongos hold" | sudo dpkg --set-selections
echo "mongodb-org-tools hold" | sudo dpkg --set-selections
```

6. Start MongoDB:
```bash
sudo systemctl start mongod
```

7. Enable MongoDB to start at boot:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable mongod
```
